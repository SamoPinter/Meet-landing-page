## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

First time I tried how to add images to media query - top hero section changes at desktop view and insted one image uses two. First time I used Figma - but I'm still not sure if I used it correctly, because some measurements don't seem to have been right.  


### Continued development

I still need to work much more on responsive design.
